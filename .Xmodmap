! This is an xmodmap input file for the Happy Hacking Keyboard, model HHKB
! Lite/Pro 2. It assumes that the keymap is already set up for a gb-105
! keyboard, then applies fixes for arrow keys and British conventions
!
! I generally prefer to have the diamond and alt keys swapped using the SW5
! dipswitch turned on - anything referring to "alt" means the key printed as
! alt, but are actually not ever used as that.
!
! Fix the arrow keys
!
