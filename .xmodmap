! This is an xmodmap input file for the Happy Hacking Keyboard, model HHKB Lite/Pro 2. It assumes that the
! keymap is already set up for a gb-105 keyboard, then applies fixes for arrow keys and British conventions
! I prefer to have the diamond and alt keys swapped using the SW5 dipswitch turned on
!
! This file makes the following changes:
!
! Fix the arrow keys
!
keycode 111 = Up
keycode 116 = Down
keycode 113 = Left
keycode 114 = Right
!
! Fix the Fn-Arrows to give PgUp, PgDown, Home and End
!
keycode 112 = Prior
keycode 117 = Next
keycode 110 = Home
keycode 115 = End
!
! Fix the Alt and Diamond keys
!
keycode 133 = Super_L
keycode 134 = Mode_switch
keycode 64 = Alt_L
keycode 108 = Alt_R
!
! Put the @ on shift-' as British keyboards do
!
keycode 48 = apostrophe at
!
! Put the " on shift-2 as British keyboards do
!
keycode 11 = 2 quotedbl
!
! Put the Pound symbol on right-diamond-3
!
keycode 12 = 3 numbersign sterling sterling
!
! Put the Euro symbol on right-diamond-e
!
keycode 26 = e E EuroSign
!
! Fix tilde
!
keycode 49 = grave asciitilde
!
! Fix backslash
!
keycode 51 = backslash bar
!

!
keycode 77 = Delete
!
!
! Remove all the existing modifier key mappings
!
clear Shift
clear Lock
clear Control
clear Mod1
clear Mod2
clear Mod3
clear Mod4
clear Mod5
!
! Put the modifier key mappings back
!
add Shift = Shift_L Shift_R
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L Control_R
!
! including this line which makes both Alt keys and the left diamond key act as Alt keys
!
add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R Super_L
!
! makes the right diamond acts as the Mode_switch modifier (mapped to right diamond above)
!
add Mod3 = Mode_switch
add Mod5 = Scroll_Lock
